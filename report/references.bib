	abstract = {This paper presents a wearable robotic orthosis for assisting flexion and extension of the wrist. The major consideration in designing this robotic orthosis was to realize a cost effective, compact, and modular design with an effective torque output. A dedicated electronic backbone was prototyped for the robotic orthosis. The robotic orthosis was designed to operate in the following three different modes for its potential use in rehabilitation: passive; active resistive; and active assistive. For the active assistive mode, a wireless strap recording force-myography ({FMG}) signals from the forearm was used. Specifically, a neural network was implemented to regress the {FMG} signals and send the control command to the orthosis. An experimental protocol was conducted to test the feasibility of the robotic orthosis, where a healthy volunteer wore the robotic orthosis and tested the three modes of operation. Results showed that the robotic orthosis was able to successfully perform the three modes of operation. Future studies will use the developed technology to assist wrist motor recovery in individuals with neuromuscular conditions.},

	abstract = {Robotic rehabilitation is a solution for recovery from neuromuscular diseases and supports physical therapists in performing high-intensity and repetitive training activities. The main reason for the limitations of rehabilitation robot utilization is economic factors because rehabilitation robot technology requires high levels of investment and relatively costly routine operation and maintenance. To facilitate widespread adoption of rehabilitation robots, low-cost, highly compliant, and simple-to-operate robotic rehabilitation devices are required. In this study, to introduce a novel alternative solution to the aforementioned problem, a low-cost, highly transparent, single pneumatic artificial muscle ({PAM}) actuated robotic therapy orthosis that enables the patient to perform all training modalities is introduced. A novel control approach was developed by combining admittance control and inverse-dynamics-based compliant controls. By means of simple counterweight loads and compliant control, quasi-static movement of the orthosis for active exercises is achieved for the full operation range of {PAM} without any jerky transitions. A new assist-active modality named ‘‘Patient Activated Assistance’’ ({PAAM}) was introduced, in which the patient was the master, and the exercise was performed as long as the patient was active, avoiding slacking. Assistance was provided by sharing the load force in accordance with the applied gain. The orthosis performance in realizing the training modalities was verified using surface electromyogram ({sEMG}) measurements. The results demonstrated that the proposed low-cost single-{PAM}-actuated robotic orthosis could be a solution to robotic rehabilitation demands, especially in low-middle-income countries ({LMIC}).},

The upper-arm circumferential strain is used to represent the contractile intensity of the dominant flexor, biceps brachii, whose behavior is described by Hill’s theory. Experiments with thirteen healthy subjects were conducted to determine the influencing factors. The temporal distributions of torque and elbow angle were measured by Biodex ®3 simultaneously, while the upper-arm circumference was obtained by a wearable anthropometric measurement device. Within the experimental range, the change of angular velocity has been found to have no effect on the torque generated. The new model was further verified experimentally with reasonable agreements obtained. The mean relative error of the torque estimated from the model is 15\% and 22\%, for isokinetic and isotonic flexions, respectively. The verified model establishes the relationship between the torque generated and circumference strain of the upper arm, for the first time, thus provide a scientific foundation for the anthropometric measurement technology as an alternative to {sEMG} for monitoring force/torque generation during elbow flexions.},

	abstract = {Background
Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. Assist-as-need control is desirable as it can optimise the rehabilitation and potentially greatly improve the patient's recovery from stroke. However, to achieve optimal assistance, the voluntary effort a patient applies must be known.
Objective
To verify the use of a particle filter to accurately estimate in real-time the voluntary torque from electromyography ({EMG}) for various subjects and movement speeds, accounting for the non-linear and time-varying behaviour of the muscle.
Methods
Ten healthy subjects performed dynamic elbow flexion at various speeds. The {EMG} of the biceps brachii and the torque were recorded. A motion model and different sensor models were developed for each data set, and the particle filter was then applied to improve the estimate of voluntary torque. The performance of the particle filter with the different sensor models was analysed.
Results
By combining the motion model and sensor model, and considering their uncertainties, the particle filter improved the estimate of voluntary torque with a mean normalised {RMS} error across all subjects and movement speeds of 6.56\%.
Conclusion
The particle filter demonstrated the ability to adapt and improve the estimate of voluntary torque, and so it is suitable for understanding the voluntary efforts and capabilities of a healthy subject. The next stages are to conduct a clinical trial to verify the effectiveness of the particle filter for subjects affected by stroke, and to analyse assist-as-need control based on the estimate of voluntary torque with a wide range of subjects.},

Many muscle activation models can be found in the literature, but no comparison is available to guide the community on limitations and improvements. In this research, an {EMG}-driven elbow motion model is developed for the purpose of evaluating muscle activation models. Seven muscle activation models are used in an optimization procedure to determine which model has the best performance. Root mean square errors in muscle torque estimation range from 1.67–2.19 Nm on average over varying input trajectories. The computational resource demand was also measured during the optimization procedure, as it is an important aspect for determining if a model is feasible for use in a particular wearable assistive device. This study provides insight into the ability of these models to estimate elbow motion and the trade-off between estimation accuracy and computational demand.},

However, due to the complexity of human structure and muscle coordination in the process of movement, it is difficult to measure the torque of human joints in vivo directly. Based on the traditional elbow double-muscle musculoskeletal model, an improved elbow neuromusculoskeletal model is proposed to predict elbow muscle torque in this paper. The number of muscles in the improved model is more complete, and the geometric model is more in line with the physiological structure of the elbow. The simulation results show that the prediction results of the model are more accurate than those of the traditional double-muscle model. Compared with the elbow muscle torque simulated by {OpenSim} software, the Pearson correlation coefficient of the two shows a very strong correlation. One-way analysis of variance ({ANOVA}) showed no significant difference, indicating that the improved elbow neuromusculoskeletal model established in this paper can well predict elbow muscle torque.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICARA.2000.4803995},
	abstract = {Numerous researchers have investigated the relationship between {EMG} and joint torque. Most of these studies use some conventional filtering (i.e. rectification followed by low pass filtering) to estimate the electromyogram ({EMG}) amplitude and then relate it to the joint torque. Currently some advanced pre-processing techniques (i.e. signal whitening) are also used to estimate the {EMG} amplitude and then relate it to joint torque. In this study we apply some pre-processing techniques like {DC} offset removal, noise filtering followed by rectification and then we calculate the moving average of the {EMG} signal. Thus we get a linear envelope (muscle activation) of the {EMG} signal and use that linear envelope to estimate the joint torque. To map the {EMG} to joint torque we propose a new mathematical model. This model has some unknown adjustable parameters, and the values of these parameters are obtained using nonlinear regression. Five subjects took part in the experiments. They were asked to perform non-fatiguing and variable force maximal voluntary contractions ({MVC}) and submaximal voluntary contractions ({SMVC}), and the resulting elbow joint torque and {EMG} signals were recorded. This recorded data was entered to the model, to estimate best fit values for the unknown parameters. Once these values of the parameters were obtained they were put into the model and thus joint torque was estimated. Predictions made by our model are well correlated with experimental data in both {MVC} and {SMVC}, the correlation coefficient and mean square error obtained for experimental data during {MVC} are 0.998 and 0.056Nm respectively. The results of this new model were compared with other existing models and some new models and it was found that our model has greater correlation and least mean square error with experimental data.

	abstract = {The tendon-sheath actuation system is capable of providing remote power transmission and greatly simplifying the mechanical design of robotic systems. However, there exist many undesirable nonlinear problems in tendon-sheath transmission, such as hysteresis, dead zone, backlash, and direction-dependent behavior. Unlike most of the existing literature that focus on the analysis of single-tendon-sheath actuation, this paper proposes a general mathematical double-tendon-sheath transmission model suitable for arbitrary types of load conditions. Experimental setups composed of servo motors, tendon-sheath components, and robot joint are established to test the proposed models and gain insights into the transmission processes through sinusoidal input signal experiments. Based on the transmission models, two open-loop control strategies are developed for the friction and deformation compensation, requiring no feedback from the distal end. With the aim of obtaining the complete model parameters, an offline identification method able to calibrate the transmission model using the sensors mounted at the proximal end is developed. The performance of the proposed control methods is evaluated by torque/position-tracking experiments in different kinds of load conditions. Moreover, the frequency characteristics of the actuation system are analyzed, and the controlled bandwidth is about 10 Hz during operation.},

	abstract = {The article proposes ﬂatness-based control and a Kalman Filter-based disturbance observer for solving the control problem of a robotic exoskeleton under time-delayed exogenous disturbances. A two-link lower-limb robotic exoskeleton is used as a case study. It is proven that this robotic system is diﬀerentially ﬂat. The robot is considered to be subject to unknown contact forces at its free-end which in turn generate unknown disturbance torques at its joints. It is shown that the dynamic model of the robotic exoskeleton can be transformed into the input-output linearized form and equivalently into the linear canonical Brunovsky form. This linearized description of the exoskeleton’s dynamics is both controllable and observable. It allows for designing a stabilizing feedback controller with the use of the pole-placement (eigenvalues assignment) method. Moreover, it allows for solving the state estimation problem with the use of Kalman Filtering (the use of the Kalman Filter on the ﬂatness-based linearized model of nonlinear dynamical systems is also known as Derivative-free nonlinear Kalman Filtering). Furthermore, (i) by extending the state vector of the exoskeleton after considering as additional state variables the additive disturbance torques which aﬀect its joints and (ii) by redesigning the Kalman Filter as a disturbance observer, one can achieve the real-time estimation of the perturbations that aﬀect this robotic system. Finally, by including in the controller of the exoskeleton additional terms that compensate for the estimated disturbance torques, the perturbations’ eﬀects can be eliminated and the precise tracking of reference trajectories by the joints of this robot can be ensured.},

	abstract = {Rehabilitation and assistance exoskeletons have been widely studied because they allow to provide more effective, intensive, and adaptive therapies; in addition, they can be used to augment the user’s capabilities in order to provide movement assistance. In particular, soft robotic exoskeletons have been researched during the past decade because they allow the device to adapt to the body contours, increasing the user’s comfort. One of the main challenges in the development of soft robotic exoskeletons is the design of controllers that allow intuitive and active control of the device. This work addresses the development of a myoelectric Model Reference Adaptive Controller ({MRAC}) with an Adaptive Kalman Filter for controlling a cable driven soft elbow exoskeleton. The proposed {MRAC} controller proved to be suitable for both passive and active control of the soft elbow exoskeleton. The controlled system achieved a Mean Absolute Error ({MAE}) of approximately 4.5° in passive mode and 10° during active mode. Additionally, the active control mode allowed an average reduction of 34\% to 40\% in the joint torque {RMS} when performing dynamic Flexion–Extension movements. The active control mode is based on a surface electromyography ({sEMG}) joint torque estimation algorithm that achieved an approximate {MAE} of 1Nm. The proposed {MRAC} controller proved to be robust enough to adapt to the exoskeleton uncertainties and external disturbances; additionally, the adaptive scheme allowed the system to operate with only two {sEMG} channels and the measurement of the joint angle, which is estimated by using two Inertial Measurement Units.},

In recent years, rehabilitation therapies based on robotics have been proposed as complement to the work of therapists. This paper introduces a prototype of exoskeleton for the evaluation and rehabilitation therapy of the elbow joint in flexion extension and pronation-supination. The main novelty is the use of bioinspired actuators based on shape memory alloys (for the first time) in an upper limb rehabilitation exoskeleton. Because of this, the device presents a light weight, less than 1 kg, and noiseless operation, both characteristics are very beneficial for rehabilitation therapies. In addition, the prototype has been designed with low-cost electronics and materials, and the result is a wearable, comfortable, and cheap rehabilitation exoskeleton for the elbow joint. The exoskeleton can generate the joint torque (active mode) or it can be used as a passive tool. (The patient performs therapy by itself, carrying the device while it collects relevant movement data for evaluation.) The simulations and experimental tests validate the solution in the first phases of rehabilitation therapies when slow and repetitive movements are required.},

The study of {EEG}-based control of assistive devices is still in early stages. Although the {EEG}-based control of assistive devices has attracted a considerable level of attention over the last few years, few studies have been carried out to systematically review these studies, as a means of offering researchers and experts a comprehensive summary of the present, state-of-the-art {EEG}-based control techniques used for assistive technology. Therefore, this research has three main goals. The first aim is to systematically gather, summarize, evaluate and synthesize information regarding the accuracy and the value of previous research published in the literature between 2011 and 2018. The second goal is to extensively report on the holistic, experimental outcomes of this domain in relation to current research. It is systematically performed to provide a wealthy image and grounded evidence of the current state of research covering {EEG}-based control for assistive rehabilitation devices to all the experts and scientists. The third goal is to recognize the gap of knowledge that demands further investigation and to recommend directions for future research in this area.},

	abstract = {Musculoskeletal models have been widely used for detailed biomechanical analysis to characterise various functional impairments given their ability to estimate movement variables (i.e., muscle forces and joint moments) which cannot be readily measured in vivo. Physics-based computational neuromusculoskeletal models can interpret the dynamic interaction between neural drive to muscles, muscle dynamics, body and joint kinematics and kinetics. Still, such set of solutions suffers from slowness, especially for the complex models, hindering the utility in real-time applications. In recent years, data-driven methods have emerged as a promising alternative due to the benefits in speedy and simple implementation, but they cannot reflect the underlying neuromechanical processes. This paper proposes a physics-informed deep learning framework for musculoskeletal modelling, where physics-based domain knowledge is brought into the data-driven model as soft constraints to penalise/regularise the data-driven model. We use the synchronous muscle forces and joint kinematics prediction from surface electromyogram ({sEMG}) as the exemplar to illustrate the proposed framework. Convolutional neural network ({CNN}) is employed as the deep neural network to implement the proposed framework. Simultaneously, the physics law between muscle forces and joint kinematics is used the soft constraint. Experimental validations on two groups of data, including one benchmark dataset and one self-collected dataset from six healthy subjects, are performed. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework.},

	abstract = {Electromechanical delay ({EMD}) was described as a time elapsed between first trigger and force output. Various results have been reported based on the measurement method with observed inconsistent results when the trigger is elicited by voluntary contraction. However, mechanomyographic ({MMG}) sensor placed far away on the skin from the contracting muscle was used to detect muscle fiber motion and excitation-contraction ({EC}) coupling which may give unreliable results. On this basis, the purpose of this study was to detect {EMD} during active muscle contraction whilst introducing an ultrafast ultrasound ({US}) method to detect muscle fiber motion from a certain depth of the muscle. Time delays between onsets of {EMG}-{MMG}, {EMG}-{US}, {MMG}-{FORCE}, {US}-{FORCE}, and {EMG}-{FORCE} were calculated as 20.5 ± 4.73, 28.63 ± 6.31, 19.21 ± 6.79, 30.52 ± 8.85, and 49.73 ± 6.99 ms, respectively. Intrarater correlation coefficient ({ICC}) was higher than {MMG} when ultrafast {US} was used for detecton of the Δt {EMG}-{US} and Δt {US}-{FORCE}, {ICC} values of 0.75 and 0.70, respectively. Synchronization of the ultrafast ultrasound with {EMG} and {FORCE} sensors can reveal reliable and clinically useful results related to the {EMD} and its components when muscle is voluntarily contracted. With ultrafast {US}, we detect onset from the certain depth of the muscle excluding the tissues above the muscle acting as a low-pass filter which can lead to inaccurate time detection about the onset of the contracting muscle fibers. With this non-invasive technique, understanding of the muscle dynamics can be facilitated.},

There are several issues that could make the delay estimation using this method subject to errors, leading frequently to estimates which are in disagreement with underlying physiology. This study introduces cortico-muscular coherence with time lag ({CMCTL}) function and proposes a method for estimating the delay based on finding its local maxima. We further address the issue of the interpretation of such time delay in multi-path propagation systems.

A bi-directional tendon-driven actuator was used for assisting both dorsiflexion and plantarflexion. The device also contains a wearable gait sensing module for measuring the leg trajectory and the foot pressures in real time for feedback control. Since the device is powered by a rechargeable battery and communicates with the main controller wirelessly, it is fully untethered, making it mobile and comfortable. Using the measured sensor data and the biomechanics of the legs, the realtime gait phase is detected, and then a gait assistance algorithm for both dorsiflexion and plantarflexion provides an accurate prediction of a control phase and timing although there are variations in the gait trajectories among individuals. As a feasibility test, the walking experiment was conducted with a post-stroke patient. The result showed improvement in both gait propulsion and foot-drop prevention.},

	abstract = {The use of inertial measurement units ({IMUs}) is a low-cost alternative for measuring joint angles. This study aims to present a low-cost open-source measurement system for joint angle estimation. The system is modular and has hardware and software. The hardware was developed using a low-cost {IMU} and microcontroller. The {IMU} data analysis software was developed in Python and has three fusion filters: Complementary Filter, Kalman Filter, and Madgwick Filter. Three experiments were performed for the proof of concept of the system. First, we evaluated the knee joint of Lokomat, with a predefined average range of motion ({ROM}) of 60∘. In the second, we evaluated our system in a real scenario, evaluating the knee of a healthy adult individual during gait. In the third experiment, we evaluated the software using data from gold standard devices, comparing the results of our software with Ground Truth. In the evaluation of the Lokomat, our system achieved an average {ROM} of 58.28∘, and during evaluation in a real scenario it achieved an average {ROM} of 44.62∘. In comparing our software with Ground Truth, we achieved a root-mean-square error of 0.04 and a mean average percentage error of 2.95\%. These results encourage the use of this system in other scenarios.},

	abstract = {In this study, we developed a range of motion sensing system ({ROMSS}) to simulate the function of the elbow joint, with errors less than 0.76 degrees and 0.87 degrees in static and dynamic verification by the swinging and angle recognition modules, respectively. In the simulation process, the ɣ correlation coefficient of the Pearson difference between the {ROMSS} and the universal goniometer was 0.90, the standard deviations of the general goniometer measurements were between ±2 degrees and ±2.6 degrees, and the standard deviations between the {ROMSS} measurements were between ±0.5 degrees and ±1.6 degrees. With the {ROMSS}, a cloud database was also established; the data measured by the sensor could be uploaded to the cloud database in real-time to provide timely patient information for healthcare professionals. We also developed a mobile app for smartphones to enable patients and healthcare providers to easily trace the data in real-time. Historical data sets with joint activity angles could be retrieved to observe the progress or effectiveness of disease recovery so the quality of care could be properly assessed and maintained.},

	abstract = {Motion capture systems are recognized as the gold standard for joint angle calculation. However, studies using these systems are restricted to laboratory settings for technical reasons, which may lead to findings that are not representative of real-life context. Recently developed commercial and home-made inertial measurement sensors (M/{IMU}) are potentially good alternatives to the laboratory-based systems, and recent technology improvements required a synthesis of the current evidence. The aim of this systematic review was to determine the criterion validity and reliability of M/{IMU} for each body joint and for tasks of different levels of complexity. Five different databases were screened (Pubmed, Cinhal, Embase, Ergonomic abstract, and Compendex). Two evaluators performed independent selection, quality assessment (consensus-based standards for the selection of health measurement instruments [{COSMIN}] and quality appraisal tools), and data extraction. Forty-two studies were included. Reported validity varied according to task complexity (higher validity for simple tasks) and the joint evaluated (better validity for lower limb joints). More studies on reliability are needed to make stronger conclusions, as the number of studies addressing this psychometric property was limited. M/{IMU} should be considered as a valid tool to assess whole body range of motion, but further studies are needed to standardize technical procedures to obtain more accurate data.},
