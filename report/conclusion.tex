\chapter{Conclusion}

In this report, the ground work for a soft elbow orthotic device's control 
system was presented. A novel current control strategy based on data driven 
torque estimation was developed. Multiple algorithms were created for its 
implementation. A sensor system containing two IMUs and an analog 
sEMG sensor was used along with said control strategy and algorithms. 
The results showed that acceptable torque estimation could be made in the load 
ranges of the NN training dataset. However, complete testing of the proposed 
control strategy was unsuccessful due to multiple fail points in the basic blocks 
of said strategy. Nevertheless, a system functioning from end-to-end was put in 
place, demonstrated by the successful testing of the simplified control strategy 
shown in Figure \ref{fig:simplified_control_diagram}. All known issues were 
discussed and several improvement paths were put forward. 

This work provides a starting point for anyone interested in experimenting with 
control systems for orthotic devices.
